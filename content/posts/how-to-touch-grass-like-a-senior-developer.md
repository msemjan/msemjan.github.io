## Introduction

You might have encountered annoying and unpleasant people online who told you to touch grass. People like that rarely explain how to do stuff, and only annoy others with their snarky comments. This might have left you confused and that is why you are here. What did they mean? And how is one supposed to touch grass anyway? In this helpful article, I will teach you how to touch grass like a true senior developer.

## Setup

This tutorial assumes that you are using a Linux computer with the `coreutils` package installed (almost all Linux distributions come with this package pre-installed, so you will most likely not have to install anything extra).

For this project, I also recommend you to create a new folder. This can be done by running the following commands:

```bash
mkdir touch-grass-project
cd $_
```

Now you are ready to actually start touching grass.

## Touching Grass

To touch grass, simply ran the following command:

```bash
touch grass
```

You can verify that you have touched the grass correctly by listing the contents of the folder:

```bash
ls -al
```

If you have done everything correctly, you should see `grass` in the output of this command, which might looks something like this:
```
$ ls -al
total 16
drwxr-xr-x   2 marek marek  4096 mar 31 17:51 .
drwx------ 115 marek marek 12288 mar 31 17:51 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 marek marek     0 mar 31 17:51 grass
```

You can re-run `touch grass` command as many times as necessary (in other words, whenever someone tells you to do it online).

## Conclusion

In this article we have taken look at `touch` command and how to use it to `touch grass`. From now on you will always know what to do when some troll online tells you to touch grass. Share it with your friends or anyone who might aspire to be a senior software developer one day.

P.S.: If it is not clear, this is an April Fools special ðŸ˜† Hope you had a laugh, or at least smiled. Stay tuned for more serious blog posts in the future.
