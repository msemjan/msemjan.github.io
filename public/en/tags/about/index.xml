I live in a small country in the heart of Europe, Slovakia 🇸🇰, where I work as a software engineering company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a child, I&amp;rsquo;ve found computers and technology fascinating and they naturally attracted me. The first language I came into contact with was Lua. At the time I was 14 or so, and I was playing the World of Warcraft (WoW) with my friends. I wanted to learn how the mods work in this game, and even write my own. They were written in Lua, so I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to properly learn it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never found time for it, and my knowledge never reached beyond the simplest things such as simple macros for selecting a random mount.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
