The fzf is a general purpose fuzzy finder that can interactively filter any kind of list, command line history, processes, host names, bookmarks, git commits, or anything else. Ever since I’ve installed in on my computer, it completely changed the way I interact with my terminal. If you are a fan of command line tools, the fzf might be perfect thing for you as well.\nInstallation The fzf is in the repositories of most popular distributions and can be easily installed with a single command:\nPackage Manager Linux Distribution Command APK Alpine Linux sudo apk add fzf APT Debian 9+/Ubuntu 19.10+ sudo apt install fzf Conda conda install -c conda-forge fzf DNF Fedora sudo dnf install fzf Nix NixOS, etc. nix-env -iA nixpkgs.fzf Pacman Arch Linux sudo pacman -S fzf pkg FreeBSD pkg install fzf pkgin NetBSD pkgin install fzf pkg_add OpenBSD pkg_add fzf Portage Gentoo emerge --ask app-shells/fzf Spack spack install fzf XBPS Void Linux sudo xbps-install -S fzf Zypper openSUSE sudo zypper install fzf Alternatively, you can build it from the source code.\nOnce everything is installed, you can try running the fzf for the first time by executing command:\nfzf By default the fzf without any arguments will search for all files inside the current directory. Once you start typing the fzf will dynamically match any search terms. Since it uses a fuzzy search algorithm, you don’t have to type the name of the file exactly. The fzf can still find it.\nAdditionally, you can setup integration with your shell:\nbash eval \"$(fzf --bash)\" zsh source \u003c(fzf --zsh) fish fzf --fish | source This will add the fzf key bindings and fuzzy completions. The new keybindings will be:\nCtrl+t - list files and folders in current directory (e.g. you can use it like this: type git add, then press Ctrl+t, select a few files using TAB, finally ENTER. Git will add the selected files.) Ctrl+r - search history of shell commands Alt+c - fuzzy change directory These key bindings can be modified further by user.\nThere is also a fzf plugin for Vim, which can be installed by adding these two lines into your ~/.vimrc file (assuming that you are using vim-plug package manager):\nPlug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -\u003e fzf#install() } } Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim' Search Syntax Unless otherwise specified, fzf starts in “extended-search mode” where you can type in multiple search terms delimited by spaces. e.g. ^music .mp3$ sbtrkt !fire.\nToken Match type Description sbtrkt fuzzy-match Items that match sbtrkt 'wild exact-match (quoted) Items that include wild ^music prefix-exact-match Items that start with music .mp3$ suffix-exact-match Items that end with .mp3 !fire inverse-exact-match Items that do not include fire !^music inverse-prefix-exact-match Items that do not start with music !.mp3$ inverse-suffix-exact-match Items that do not end with .mp3 If you wish to search for an exact word or phrase, start fzf with -e or --exact option.\nNote: When --exact is set, '-prefix “unquotes” the term.\nA single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following query matches entries that start with core and end with either go, rb, or py.\n^core go$ | rb$ | py$ Using fzf In Your Scripts The true power of the fzf can be shown when we use it for various scripts.\nBasic Idea All of your scripts will be based on a single simple principle. We can pipe data into the fzf and then search in it using the fzf interface. The fzf will then output the selected text. For example, we can make a simple yes-no selector like this:\n#!/bin/sh selected=$(echo -e \"Yes\\nNo\" | fzf --prompt \"Select one of the options\") echo \"User selected $selected\" The --prompt flag adds a message for the user. By the way, -e flag seems to be necessary in echo. I’ve tried without, but the text was on a single line, and therefore we would have gotten only a single option. Once executed, we will be prompted to select one of the two options:\n╭────────────────────────────────────╮ │ Select one of the options │ │ 2/2 ──────────────────────────── │ │ ▌ Yes │ │ No │ ╰────────────────────────────────────╯ Then the selected answer will be printed by using echo. This may seem simple, but it gives us wide possibilities. Below are a couple of simple examples to inspire you to write your own.\nExample - Integration With Tmux If you are using Tmux, it may be interesting for you to use the fzf-tmux command instead of the plain fzf. It works well with Tmux and with a p flag the selection will display floating above the panes, and I find it more readable compared to launching fzf in a smaller pane.\nIf you are not using Tmux at the moment, the fzf-tmux will run the normal fzf. The fzf-tmux has the same options as the normal fzf.\nExample - Setting Size Of Fzf Window The width and height of the frame around the fzf selector can be adjusted according to the one’s preferences with --weigth/-w (for width) and --heigth/-h (for heigth) flags:\nfzf -w 60% -h 30% This will make the fzf’s 60% of the window’s width and 30% of the window’s height.\nExample - Preview It is possible to add a preview of the currently selected file. The preview is set using the --preview flag followed by a command that is used to create the preview. For example, you can be satisfied by using a simple cat command:\nls note | fzf --preview \"cat ~/notes/{}\" The {} is replaced with the name of the selected file. The full path is necessary, because otherwise the cat will fail to find the file, unless you are in notes folder.\nSince I actually have some notes at ~/notes, here is an example:\n╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ \u003e ╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮ │ │ 931/931 ──────────────────────────────── │ --- │ │ │ AWS_dynamodb.md ││ title: \"Amazon Fargate\" │ │ │ AWS_elastic_block_storage_ebs.md │ author: \"Marek S.\" │ │ │ AWS_elastic_cloud_compute_ec2.md │ summary: \"Amazon Fargate is a fully-managed serverless service for running containerized applications on AWS.\" │ │ │ AWS_elastic_container_registry_ecr.md │ date: 2023-07-11T15:21:21Z+0200 │ │ │ AWS_elastic_container_service_ecs.md │ type: note │ │ │ AWS_elastic_file_system_efs.md │ draft: true │ │ │ AWS_elastic_kubernetes_service_eks.md │ tags: │ │ │ AWS_elastic_load_balancer_elb.md │ - \"Containers\" │ │ │ ▌ AWS_fargate.md │ - \"Container-Orchestration\" │ │ │ AWS_index.md │ │ │ │ AWS_lambda.md │ │ │ │ AWS_list_of_services_with_descriptions.m │ │ │ │ AWS_mq.md ╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ │ ╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯ The position, size, and text wrapping of the preview window can be changed, by using --preview-window with right, left, top, and bottom options, followed by : and size in percents, another : separator, and the last is either wrap or nowrap. E.g.:\nls note | fzf --preview-window=top:80%:nowrap --preview \"cat ~/notes/{}\" Example - Default Settings Writing the same setting such as the width and height will quickly get old. If you always want the same setting, you can export the settings into the FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS environment variable, and fzf will use it.\nIn my .bashrc file I have the following export:\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS='--height 40% --layout=reverse --border --preview-window=right:70%:wrap' It sets the default height of the fzf window to 40% (default is 100%, which I didn’t like), --layout=reverse puts the prompt at the top instead of the default bottom, --border adds the border, and --preview-window sets the size of the window, puts it on the right side and sets the text wrapping.\nAll the options and their values can be found on the fzf’s Github page\nExample - Searching Notes In the following example we have a fuzzy search for notes in our notes folder. If no matching note is found, a new one is conditionally created based on the user input.\n#!/bin/sh # Location of the notes NOTES_FOLDER=\"$HOME/notes/\" # The extension/suffix that I want for my notes (my notes are in Markdown) SUFFIX=\".md\" # Select a file from the notes folder selection=$(ls $NOTES_FOLDER | fzf-tmux $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS \\ --prompt \"Select a note\" -h 80% -w 80% \\ --preview \"cat $NOTES_FOLDER{}\") if [ -z \"$selection\" ] then # If there isn't such a note ask user if the note should be created selection=$( \\ printf \"Yes\\nNo\" | fzf-tmux $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS -h 80% -w 80% \\ --prompt \"There is no such entry. Create a new one?\" \\ ) case \"$selection\" in # The user wants the new note \"Yes\") # Prompt for the name of the new note echo \"Name of the new article? (without $SUFFIX suffix)\" read name header=\"# $name\" # Remove spaces and convert the name to lower case selection=\"$(echo $name | sed -e 's/\\(.*\\)/\\L\\1/' | sed 's/\\ /_/g').wiki\" # Create the new wiki file touch \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" # Insert the title echo \"$header\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" echo \"\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" # Insert the skeleton outline echo \"## Introduction\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" echo \"\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" echo \"## Main Idea\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" echo \"\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" echo \"## Conclusions\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" echo \"\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" echo \"## Sources\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" echo \"\" \u003e\u003e \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" ;; # The users selects no + default: Exit *) echo \"Ok, ok ... I am quitting then.\\n\" exit ;; esac fi # If the note exists or was just created, open it in the default browser (you # should have EDITOR variable defined) $EDITOR \"$NOTES_FOLDER$selection\" Example - Emoji Selector In this example we create a simple emoji picker.\nFirst download the emoji.txt file from Github. You can use wget or do it using your favorite browser:\nwget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/keidarcy/128141ff30a8c3f9ddc0d6c3ecb5b334/raw/8fc6b9efe6b72e8a876639e239043d492e857746/emoji.txt The content of the file looks something like this:\n😌 :relieved: 😆 :satisfied: 😁 :grin: 😉 :wink: 😜 :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: 😝 :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: 😀 :grinning: 😗 :kissing: 😙 :kissing_smiling_eyes: 😛 :stuck_out_tongue: 😴 :sleeping: 😟 :worried: 😦 :frowning: Each line consists of an emoji and an emoji name separated by a single space. The script that selects an emoji, and removes the name is a trivial one-liner:\n#!/bin/sh cat emoji.txt | fzf | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | xsel -ib The cut -d ' ' -f 1 cuts the input into two columns divided by a single space, then returns the value from the first column. The xsel -ib will copy the emoji into the clipboard. You can remove this part, or replace it with something else.\nNote: Some emojies are missing in the file. I don’t know why, it is not my file.\nExample - Select Songs In Cmus Using FZF Cmus is a small, fast CLI music player for Unix-like systems. This snippet shows a simple script that picks a song from a give folder. Than queues the song. Entire folders can be selected as well.\n#!/bin/bash # Folder where is your music music_folder=\"/path/to/Music/\" # Select desired music using fzf selection=$(find \"$music_folder\" | fzf-tmux --prompt \"Select a song:\") # Quit if nothing was selected if [[ $selection -ef $HOME ]]; then exit; fi # Add the selected music to the queue using Cmus' CLI cmus-remote -l \"$selection\" # If a specific music file was selected, play it immediately if [ -f \"$selection\" ]; then cmus-remote -f \"$selection\"; fi Example - Multiple Selections It is possible to select more than one entry with -m/--multi flag. I don’t use this feature very often, but I have a nice example that might be useful: That is a simple one-liner files, which lets you select the files that should be staged using git add command:\ngit add $(fzf --multi) You can select several options by pressing TAB key. This will select/unselect the current line and then move down. To select the entry and move the pointer down, press Shift+TAB.\nConclusion In this blog post I’ve showed you how to install the fuzzy finder and added several examples to help you get started. Ever since I’ve installed the fzf on my computer, the way I interact with terminal changed. The fzf is extremely useful tool that I would recommend to everyone who likes/needs to work with terminal everyday.\nThe possibility of using the fzf in scripts greatly extends its usefulness. I use it all the time to create simple CLI interfaces for selecting files or even simple Yes/No questions. Moreover there are many examples of scripts online. People use it for all sorts of things, including selecting browser bookmarks, simplifying interactions with Git, selecting panes in Tmux, selecting jrnl entries from a particular day, selecting Spotify songs, and so much more! There are many example on fzf’s Github wiki.\n",

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a> is a general purpose fuzzy finder that can interactively filter any kind of list, command line history, processes, host names, bookmarks, git commits, or anything else. Ever since I&rsquo;ve installed in on my computer, it completely changed the way I interact with my terminal. If you are a fan of command line tools, the fzf might be perfect thing for you as well.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#using-git">build it</a> from the source code.</p>
<p>Once everything is installed, you can try running the fzf for the first time by executing command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>fzf
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By default the fzf without any arguments will search for all files inside the current directory. Once you start typing the fzf will dynamically match any search terms. Since it uses a fuzzy search algorithm, you don&rsquo;t have to type the name of the file exactly. The fzf can still find it.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can setup integration with your shell:</p>
<ul>
<li>bash
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>eval <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>fzf --bash<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>zsh
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-zsh" data-lang="zsh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>source &lt;<span style="color:#f92672">(</span>fzf --zsh<span style="color:#f92672">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
<li>fish
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fish" data-lang="fish"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">fzf</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">--fish</span> <span style="color:#f92672">|</span> source
</span></span></code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>This will add the fzf key bindings and fuzzy completions. The new keybindings will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ctrl+t</code> - list files and folders in current directory (e.g. you can use it like this: type <code>git add</code>, then press <code>Ctrl+t</code>, select a few files using <code>TAB</code>, finally <code>ENTER</code>. Git will add the selected files.)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl+r</code> - search history of shell commands</li>
<li><code>Alt+c</code> - fuzzy change directory</li>
</ul>
<p>These key bindings can be <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Configuring-shell-key-bindings">modified further</a> by user.</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf plugin for Vim</a>, which can be installed by adding these two lines into your <code>~/.vimrc</code> file (assuming that you are using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a> package manager):</p>

<p>If you wish to search for an exact word or phrase, start fzf with <code>-e</code> or <code>--exact</code> option.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When <code>--exact</code> is set, <code>'</code>-prefix &ldquo;unquotes&rdquo; the term.</p>
<p>A single bar character term acts as an OR operator. For example, the following query matches entries that start with <code>core</code> and end with either <code>go</code>, <code>rb</code>, or <code>py</code>.</p>

<p>All of your scripts will be based on a single simple principle. We can pipe data into the fzf and then search in it using the fzf interface. The fzf will then output the selected text. For example, we can make a simple yes-no selector like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh

</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>echo <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;User selected </span>$selected<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>--prompt</code> flag adds a message for the user. By the way, <code>-e</code> flag seems to be necessary in <code>echo</code>. I&rsquo;ve tried without, but the text was on a single line, and therefore we would have gotten only a single option. Once executed, we will be prompted to select one of the two options:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>╭────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Select one of the options          │
│   2/2 ──────────────────────────── │
│ ▌ Yes                              │
│   No                               │
╰────────────────────────────────────╯
</code></pre><p>Then the selected answer will be printed by using <code>echo</code>. This may seem simple, but it gives us wide possibilities. Below are a couple of simple examples to inspire you to write your own.</p>
<h3 id="example---integration-with-tmux">Example - Integration With Tmux<a href="#example---integration-with-tmux" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"

      <line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line>

<p>If you are using Tmux, it may be interesting for you to use the fzf-tmux command instead of the plain fzf. It works well with Tmux and with a <code>p</code> flag the selection will display floating above the panes, and I find it more readable compared to launching fzf in a smaller pane.</p>
<p>If you are not using Tmux at the moment, the fzf-tmux will run the normal fzf. The fzf-tmux has the same options as the normal fzf.</p>

<p>The width and height of the frame around the fzf selector can be adjusted according to the one&rsquo;s preferences with <code>--weigth</code>/<code>-w</code> (for width) and <code>--heigth</code>/<code>-h</code> (for heigth) flags:</p>

<p>It is possible to add a preview of the currently selected file. The preview is set using the <code>--preview</code> flag followed by a command that is used to create the preview. For example, you can be satisfied by using a simple <code>cat</code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>ls note | fzf --preview <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;cat ~/notes/{}&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>{}</code> is replaced with the name of the selected file. The full path is necessary, because otherwise the <code>cat</code> will fail to find the file, unless you are in <code>notes</code> folder.</p>
<p>Since I actually have some notes at <code>~/notes</code>, here is an example:</p>

</code></pre><p>The position, size, and text wrapping of the preview window can be changed, by using <code>--preview-window</code> with <code>right</code>, <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, and <code>bottom</code> options, followed by <code>:</code> and size in percents, another <code>:</code> separator, and the last is either <code>wrap</code> or <code>nowrap</code>.

<p>Writing the same setting such as the width and height will quickly get old. If you always want the same setting, you can export the settings into the <code>FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS</code> environment variable, and fzf will use it.</p>
<p>In my <code>.bashrc</code> file I have the following export:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;--height 40% --layout=reverse --border --preview-window=right:70%:wrap&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It sets the default height of the fzf window to 40% (default is 100%, which I didn&rsquo;t like), <code>--layout=reverse</code> puts the prompt at the top instead of the default bottom, <code>--border</code> adds the border, and <code>--preview-window</code> sets the size of the window, puts it on the right side and sets the text wrapping.</p>
<p>All the options and their values can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf&rsquo;s Github page</a></p>

<p>It is possible to select more than one entry with <code>-m</code>/<code>--multi</code> flag. I don&rsquo;t use this feature very often, but I have a nice example that might be useful: That is a simple one-liner files, which lets you select the files that should be staged using <code>git add</code> command:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can select several options by pressing <code>TAB</code> key. This will select/unselect the current line and then move down. To select the entry and move the pointer down, press <code>Shift+TAB</code>.</p>

<p>In this blog post I&rsquo;ve showed you how to install the fuzzy finder and added several examples to help you get started. Ever since I&rsquo;ve installed the fzf on my computer, the way I interact with terminal changed. The fzf is extremely useful tool that I would recommend to everyone who likes/needs to work with terminal everyday.</p>
<p>The possibility of using the fzf in scripts greatly extends its usefulness. I use it all the time to create simple CLI interfaces for selecting files or even simple Yes/No questions. Moreover there are many examples of scripts online. People use it for all sorts of things, including selecting browser bookmarks, simplifying interactions with Git, selecting panes in Tmux, selecting <a href="https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl">jrnl</a> entries from a particular day, <a href="https://github.com/AndreaOrru/fzf-mopidy-spotify.vim">selecting  Spotify songs</a>, and so much more! There are many example on <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/wiki/Examples">fzf&rsquo;s Github wiki</a>.</p>
